## Contributing
When working on a feature, create a seperate branch from `dev` branch just for that feature. Only work on that feature on there, to avoid having problems in the future with multiple features in one push.

When finished, a pull request will be created. Here you can write down what you have made, how it works, and ask for a review. Make sure the review is done by one of the lead programmers.

Once its approved, your feature will be merged into the development branch, and you can start the process over for the next feature.
